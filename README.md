Introduction


This app was created to help me and my wife to divide our money between our different accounts and to keep track of how much we've paid. It's basically a calculator which removes some of the hustle when doing our home economy. 

The whole idea with this was to make it easier to make sure that you and your partner have the same amount of money left after bills and other expenses have been paid even if you don't have the same salary.

Instructions


The way this work is that you fill in your salary in the salary field. If you planning on putting in x amount of money on your food account you simply write that amount in the food input. That amount will then be subtracted from your "What you have left" field.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have no empty fields. Always write at least a 0 on the different accounts, otherwise, the numbers will get crazy.


###
Installation 

Simply clone or download the repo and run it locally. Change the items in the expences array to match your accounts and make sure that these items match the items in the value object. You'll find all this in the ExpenceList.js file.
